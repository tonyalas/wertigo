# Wertigo

Think Local, Live Local.

The local-friendly website for when you ask yourself where to go.

## Goal

Wertigo's mission is to provide new and small (but not limited to) local businesses a chance to be discovered. We believe the first thought on your mind when trying to find a place to eat, shop, or have fun, should be to check local.

How many times are you with friends and trying to brainstorm ideas of where to go, but are tired of the usual chain spots? How about when you need to find a local spot to find a specific service? 

Nowadays, many independent and new businesses primarily use Instagram and other social media sites to advertise themselves, but can often get drowned out in the sea of similar names. If your name doesn't include the specific word that people are looking for, it might be impossible for them to ever find you. 

This is where Wertigo tries to bridge that gap and provide a place to aggregate all the local businesses that might need an easier way of reaching new customers. You can filter by category and search by name or tags to find just the right place that meets your criteria.
